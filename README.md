# ALX Higher-Level Programming with Python

This repository contains tasks and exercises for learning the Python programming language as part of the ALX Software Engineering program.

## Getting Started

Before beginning this course, it is recommended that you have a basic understanding of computer fundamentals. Python is a high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. You don't need any prior programming experience to start learning Python.

To get started with Python, you will need to have Python installed on your computer. Python is available for multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. You can download the latest version of Python from the official Python website: [https://www.python.org](https://www.python.org).

## Task Structure

The tasks are organized into modules, each covering a specific topic in Python programming. Each module contains:

- A README.md file that provides an overview of the topics covered and the learning objectives
- A set of exercises that will help you practice the concepts covered in the module

The tasks are designed to be challenging, and it is recommended that you attempt to complete them on your own before referring to the provided solutions.

## Coding Style

We will follow the PEP 8 style guide for all our Python code. PEP 8 is the official style guide for Python, and it provides guidelines for writing clean and consistent Python code. You can find more information about PEP 8 [Here](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

## Contributing
